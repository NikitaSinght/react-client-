MERN is the acronym for MongoDB, Express JS, React JS and Node JS.
MERN stack is a combination of the above technologies, all based on JavaScript, 
used to build advanced web applications. It is an open source full stack development framework

 1. MongoDB:
-MongoDB is an open source, cross platform, NoSql DBMS.
It is a document oriented database, which means that data is saved using 
collections and documents, instead of tables and rows, like in a relational
database. This makes possible easier and faster data integration within applications.

2. Express JS:
Express JS is a modular, lightweight framework of the Node JS, that helps in building web applications.
It is a server side, back-end, JavaScript based framework, that is designed to write simplified, fast and secure applications.
It can be assumed that Express JS, runs on top of the Node JS, managing the server and its routes

3. React JS:
React JS is an open source JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, typically for single page applications.
React JS enables developers to modify/edit and refresh the page to view the changes without having to restart or reload the page.
React JS offers the facility of code reusability on multiple platforms.
-It is fast and scalable

4. Node JS:
Node JS is an open-source, cross platform, JavaScript runtime environment.
-It is designed to run the JavaScript code outside the browser, on the server side.

What is MERN Stack â€” Advantages
With MongoDB under its hood for higher scalability, Express JS for speed enhancements, JavaScript as its primary language for end-to-end development, MERN is one of the best full stack development suites after MEAN.
